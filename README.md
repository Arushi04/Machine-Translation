# Machine Translation from English to French using word embeddings, kNN and locality sensitive hashing

### Dataset
English embeddings(subset) : https://code.google.com/archive/p/word2vec/
French embeddings(subset in data folder)

### Concepts covered
* Translation word vectors from one language to another using matric translation and word embeddings
* Finding the most similar vector of the translated vector using k-nearest neighbour
* Finding the most similar tweets using locality sensitive hashing that divides the space into multiple hash buckets and use approximate k-nn to find the most similar tweet
* Document Embedding

### Requirements
* Python 3.6.10  
* Numpy 1.18.4  
* Gensim 3.8.3
* NLTK 3.5
